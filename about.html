            <p class="about__bio">Hi there! I'm Lucy, a yoga teacher based in Brighton. I'm also a practitioner, and academic researcher (of yoga) at the Royal College of Art.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">Yoga is a living prayer that I feel called to share. My classes may be gentle, physically challenging, or both. But they are not a "workout". Yoga is a "work-in". It's a chance to meet yourself where you are, rather than getting caught up in thought patterns that don't serve you.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">As a teacher and practitioner, my intial frame of reference is the Hatha Yoga that my mother taught. Her class themes and posture sequences were directly inspired by nature's rhythm, which gave them a shamanic and story-telling quality.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">Growing up, I enjoyed helping out at my mother's studio and with her class plans. You can imagine that it's quite fun as a kid! Then I went to Durham University to study French, Spanish, and Philosophy. At Durham, I was an active member of the Yoga and Pilates Society. On graduating, I realised that the normal desk job wouldn't satisfy me! So, I used the remainder of my student loan to buy a plane ticket to Goa. I gained my Yoga Alliance 200 hr qualification at a humble yoga school with real integrity.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">Training to teach certainly was a turning point. I haven't looked back. I have completed additional trainings in Embodied Yoga Principles (45hrs), Thai Yoga Massage (48hrs), and Vajrasati Yoga, which draws on alignment principles from Iyengar Yoga (500hrs en route). My main self-practice is Vinyasa Flow, with lots of natural movement.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">Beyond yoga, I love sea-swimming with the <a href="http://www.totalimmersion.co.uk/" target="_blank">Total Immersion</a> method, and in 2016 I swam to the Isle of Wight in order to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease Association. I used to play football and captained a women's team, but ended up severely tearing a couple of ligaments in my ankle. Ouch! I've slowly rebuilt my ankle strength through yoga and <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/blog/october-2017/daily-exercise-tutorials" target="_blank">barefoot running</a> techniques.</p>
            <p class="about__bio">I am commited to making my yoga classes accessible, consensual, body positive, educational, creative, experiential, connecting, loving, balanced, challenging in ways you don't expect, and empowering for the student (that's you maybe).</p>
